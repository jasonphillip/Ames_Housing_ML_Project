# Background and Project Focus
One of the top ways you can increase the value of your home is with a kitchen renovation. For this project, we cosplayed as a kitchen renovation company in Ames, Iowa during the years 2006-2010. Given the nature of that business, it's crucial for us to find neighborhoods where homebuyers value kitchen quality. A higher demand for high-quality kitchens will likely result in more investment in upgrading kitchens, in turn, increasing property values. In this blog post, we will discuss how we utilized the Ames Iowa housing dataset, a random forest model, and SHAP values to identify the impact of kitchen quality on house prices and identify potential neighborhoods for our services. We will also explore the questions of whether certain neighborhoods value kitchen quality more than others, and if this preference is reflected in the sale prices of the houses.
